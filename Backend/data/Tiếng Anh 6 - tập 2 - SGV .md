WARM-UP & INTRODUCTION  

Aims:  

- To create a friendly and active atmosphere in the class before the lesson;  

- To give the teacher and Ss a chance to introduce themselves;  

- To lead into the new unit.  

 Review the previous unit before Ss open their books. Organise a short if you remember  game to revise how other countries celebrate their New Years. For example, T can say  Throwing water on other people and Ss respond Thailand. Continue with about 4 - 5  countries Ss have learnt from Unit 6.  

Create a spider web. To start the lesson, write the word TELEVISION in the centre of  the web and ask Ss to call out words related to the topic. T may allow them to give  Vietnamese words and ask other Ss in the class for the English equivalent. Then write  in the corner of the board a list of the words Ss don’t know and ask them to keep a  record for later reference when the unit finishes.  

## GETTING STARTED

## A CLOSER LOOK 1

Vocabulary  

ACTIVITY 1  

Aim: To teach the terms reduce, reuse, and recycle.  

-  Have Ss read the information in the table and draw a line from a symbol in column A to the matching  word in column B and its meaning in column C. Ss work in pairs to compare their answers before giving T the answers. Check and write the correct answers on the board.  



-  For stronger classes, elicit the difference between recycle and reuse from Ss. Explain the difference  between these two terms again if necessary:  

+ Recycle means reprocessing an old item such as a newspaper, a glass or a can and turning it into a  new product. For example, used paper is brought to a factory where it is reprocessed, cleaned and  purified. This paper is then used to make new things such as books or newspapers.  

+ Reuse means avoiding the reprocessing procedure. It is when people use something over and over  again until it cannot be used any more. For example, a used plastic bottle can be used again as a  flower vase, or a butter container can be used to grow a small plant.  

ACTIVITY 2  

Aim: To revise / teach the words for things that can be reduced, reused and recycled.  

- Have Ss work in pairs to do this activity. Call on Ss from different pairs to go to the board and write the  words.  

-  This activity can also be organised as a competition. Whichever pair finishes the activity first wins and can go to the board to write their answers. Confirm the correct answers.  

Key:  

1. rubbish 		2. plastic bag		 3. glass	 4. plastic bottle  

5.noise			 6. paper		 7. water 	8. clothes  

ACTIVITY 3  

Aim: To help Ss categorise things that can be reduced, reused and recycled.  

- Have Ss work in pairs to put the words from 2 in appropriate groups. Draw the table on the  board and call three Ss to go to the board and write their answers. Discuss the answers with the class.  

Suggested answers:  



-  Elicit some more words for each group from Ss. Here are some suggested words:  

● Reduce: electricity, gas  

● Reuse: envelope, carton box, textbook  

● Recycle: newspaper, textbook, plastic container  

Pronunciation  

Rhythm in sentences  

ACTIVITY 4  

Aim: To get Ss familiar with rhythm in sentences.  

-  Tell Ss that in English, the stressed and unstressed syllables combine to make rhythm in a sentence.  Ss have learnt about stress in two-syllable words, so T can remind them of the stress rule in two-syllable  words (put stress on the first syllable in nouns and adjectives).  

- In the sentences the bold parts are the stressed syllables. The aim of this activity is only to raise  Ss‘ awareness of rhythm. It is not necessary to teach them in detail.  

-  Play the recording for Ss to listen to the sentences. Have them pay attention to the bold parts. Play the  recording of each sentence again for Ss to repeat in chorus. Have Ss work in pairs to practise reading  the sentences. Call on some Ss to read the sentences aloud. Comment on Ss’ pronunciation.    

Audio script:  

1. If you cycle, it'll help the Earth.  

2.Water is good for your body.  

3. The students are planting trees in the garden.  

4.Is it better to use paper bags?  

5. We are happy to walk to school. 

ACTIVITY 5  

Aim: To give Ss further practice with rhythm in sentences.  

-  Play the recording for Ss to listen to the conversation. Have them pay attention to the bold parts.  

- Play the recording of each sentence again for Ss to repeat in chorus. Have Ss work in pairs to  practise reading the conversation. Call on some Ss to read the conversation aloud. Comment on  Ss’ pronunciation.  

Audio script:  

Vy: What are you doing?  

Mi: I'm writing an article about going green.  

Vy: Great! I'm writing a poem about the 3Rs.  

Mi: Let me read it.  

Vy: I'm still writing. Wait for a minute.

- Use the information in this table to explain to Ss:  

There are two kinds of articles in English.  

1. Indefinite article: a / an  

a + consonant sound an + vowel sound (a, é, i, 0, u)  

E.g.a bag E.g. an apple  

2. Definite article: the  

the /6a/ + consonant sound the /di/ + vowel sound (a, e, i, 0, u)  

E.g. the bag E.g. the apple

 Unit 12

## GETTING STARTED

AT AN INTERNATIONAL ROBOT SHOW  

ACTIVITY 1  

Aims:  

- To set the context for the introductory text;  

-  To introduce the topic of the unit.  

-  Set the context for the introductory text by asking Ss questions such as Where are Nick, Phong and  Dr Adams?, What are they talking about? T can ask Ss to guess Dr Adams’ job. T can also ask Ss to share  any recent experiences of visiting a show: Have you ever been to a show?, Where and when?, What did  you see there? Encourage Ss to give T their answers, but do not confirm whether their answers are right  or wrong. Ask them to talk a bit about types of robots they know.  

-  Play the recording twice for Ss to listen and read along. Have Ss underline the words that are related to  the topic of the unit while they are listening and reading.  

-  Invite some pairs of Ss to read the dialogue aloud.  

- Ask Ss what exactly Nick, Phong, and Dr Adams are talking about. Now confirm the correct answer  (They are talking about what the robots in the show can do).  

-  Have Ss say the words in the text that they think are related to the topic Robots. Quickly write the words  on one part of the board. Comment on Ss’ answers.  

ACTIVITY 2  

Aim: To help Ss understand the text.  

-  Have Ss look at the statements in this activity. Tell them how to do it. Give them some strategies to do  the exercise (e.g. reading the statements, underlining the key words, reading the text paying attention  to the key words, deciding if each sentence is true or false).  

- Set a time limit for Ss to do the activity independently. When the time is up, have Ss share their answers  in pairs. Invite some pairs to give their answers and confirm the correct ones. For stronger classes, ask  Ss to correct the false sentences.  

Key: 1.T 	2.F 	3.T 	4.F	 5.T  

ACTIVITY 3  

Aim: To help Ss further understand the text.  

- Ask Ss to work independently to fill each blank with the adjective in the box from the conversation.  T may instruct them how to do the exercise: (1) read the sentence with the blank and try to work out the  meaning from the whole sentence; (2) find the adjective in the box that can fit the blank meaningfully.  Model with the first sentence.  

-  Allow Ss to share answers before discussing as a class. Write the correct answers on the board.    

Key: 1. useful 		2. fast 		3. strong 	4.smart 	5. heavy

-  Asksome Ss to read out their answers or write them on the board. Check the answers as a class.  

- With weaker classes, ask for the translations of the activities. With stronger classes, T may ask some  additional questions, e.g. Can you iron clothes /make meals ...? Who often makes meals in your family? etc.    

Key: 1.b 	2.c 	3.e 		4.d 		5.f		 6.a  

ACTIVITY 5  

Aim: To help Ss practise saying phrases of daily activities introduced in 4.  

- Demonstrate the game to the class first. Ask a stronger student to help you.  

- Ask Ss to play in groups. In a weaker class, T may work together with Ss first: miming one or two activities  in 4 and eliciting the answers. When they know exactly what to do, ask them to work in groups.  

- Askone or two Ss to tell the class what they have learnt. Ask Ss to say some words they remember from  the lesson.  

-  If there is a visualiser in the classroom, show the dialogue and highlight the key words related to the  topic. It would be helpful if T also highlights in the dialogue the superlative adjectives and tells Ss that  they will learn these language points in the following lessons.

## PROJECT  

This is to introduce Ss to another way of practising talking about the skills and abilities of the robots they  will design.  

ACTIVITY 1  

Ask Ss to work in groups, discussing what the robot they are designing will be like. Ss may use their  imagination to design a robot with the most useful skills and abilities. Write the description of their  robot in the table given. Remind them that they do not have to write full sentences and they can use  abbreviations. Finally, draw their robot in the space provided.  

ACTIVITY 2  

Ask each group to show the picture and the description of their robot and present their design to the  whole class. When all groups have presented their designs, T may display all or some of the designs on  the wall or notice board and have the whole class vote on the best robot.  

If T thinks there may be limited time in this lesson for the project, T can assign the project in earlier lessons  such as in GETTING STARTED lesson. Make sure you guide them carefully and check their progress after  each lesson. In the last lesson (LOOKING BACK), ask Ss to present their robots to the class.
